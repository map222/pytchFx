The simple Monte-Carlo style sampling has a problem for the edge of the strikezone. Because most pitches are in the zone, if you try to sample pitches in a range around a given pitch, your sample will be biased towards the strike zone, and your ball/strike numbers will be off. For example, with a sample of pitches centered around -1 feet in x-axis, you get these results:
In play, no out    0.048674
In play, out(s)    0.141431
In play, run(s)    0.024187
Called Strike      0.246617
Hit By Pitch       0.000048
Ball               0.237676
Foul               0.210420
Swinging Strike    0.090935

But for the resampled data based off these pitches, you get these results:
In play, no out    0.067897
In play, out(s)    0.178308
In play, run(s)    0.030812
Called Strike      0.281892
Hit By Pitch       0.000053
Ball               0.111492
Foul               0.255271
Swinging Strike    0.074275
