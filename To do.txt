0. Rework my resampling code to not dynamically change the size of the results.

1. Write helper function that creates new column on pitch_ab dataframe that converts pitch['des'] and ab['event'] to a unified column with factors [ball, swing strike, call strike, single, double, triple, HR, out]

2. Check if my dynamic appending of pandas dataframes in helpers.get_samples_from_templates() is causing a slowdown
